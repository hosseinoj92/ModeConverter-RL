# ModeConverter-RL


The objective of this project is to design a mode converter which inputs the mode TE00 and outputs TE20. In this Project we use Reinforcement learning algorithms to come up with a design that can convert the modes with the best efficiency possible. In the beginning a single wafer with a homogenous layer of silicon-nitride on top is assumed. This wafer contains pixels and the number of pixels based on their size is adjustable. We can flip these pixels and replace each silicon-nitride pixel with air.

The Goal is to come up with a configuration, which enhances the efficiency of mode conversion.
